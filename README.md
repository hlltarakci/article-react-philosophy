 I think the smoothest way to deal with some tech is to understand minds of its creators.. With what principles they keep in mind while creating it and to much extend they stayed loyal to these principles.. There are few principles and many rules that supports/derived from them.. So, unless we don't feel and assimilate the principles, it is more likely we deal with bugs as we move forward, since rules will start not to make sense as things to deal with get advanced.. Luckily, react team shares what they have in their mind.. So lets just read and amaze the work they did with react :)
